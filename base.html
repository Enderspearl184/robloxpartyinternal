        <h1>Roblox Server Reserver</h1>
        Enter a place id, and you will (hopefully) be sent to a NEW SERVER for that game!!<br>
        This is useful for gamenights or similar situations where you want a NEW, COMPLETELY EMPTY SERVER!<br>
        also this is probably going to be used as a base for a party system recreation<br>
        which may end up costing robux to use so enjoy this while u can!!
        <!--
            clickable link for if the game does not launch
            have it like disappear when the request button is clicked and make it appear again
            so the user knows that it Worked!
